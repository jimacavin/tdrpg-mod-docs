#1. Introduction & Terminology for n00bs

So, you want to make a mod for Defender’s Quest. This guide will show you how.

There is a [mod editor](https://github.com/Autoquark/dq1-unofficial-mod-editor) in the works, but it's in very early stages.
Until it's finished, you’ll be doing almost everything using simple text and image editors.

If you don’t know what XML is, for instance, I suggest [reading up on that now](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

**NOTE:**
*This guide is a work in progress. Many of the sections are stubs and still need to be filled out. Also, mod functionality has not been robustly tested, and might need a few more patches to bring it up to speed. I’ll need some help from adventurous modders to test the limits of the system.*

**SPOILER ALERT:**
*If you’re poking around in the game’s data files, you will come across spoilers! This guide talks about these files in great detail, so it will also contain lots of spoilers. Play the game first if you don’t want to be spoiled!*

##1.0 Terminology for n00bs

Feel free to skip this section and refer back to it later as necessary.

You don’t need any programming experience to make a Defender’s Quest mod, but throughout this documentation I will be using some light programming jargon, as well as some terminology specific to Defender’s Quest. Here’s a quick rundown:

###Defender’s Quest Jargon:

**TD-RPG:**
This means “Tower Defense Role Playing Game” and was the original code-name for the project.

**Labels vs. Variables:**
A label is the piece of text that we display to the player in game and is consistent with the game’s theme and story. Often we’ll have an internal representation of that thing in game data that goes by some other name, sometimes similar, sometimes completely different, and often has no relation to the game’s theme, it’s just a mechanical word for our own use. This internal representation is called a “variable.” The following entry is a good example.

**Mcguffin:**
Although Azra’s character class is displayed as “Librarian” in game, her character class is referred to throughout the code and game data as “mcguffin.” This is because she is the “Tower Defense McGuffin”, ie the thing you have to arbitrarily defend.

**Unazra:**
The mysterious sorceress, Tletl-Metzli, was originally named “unazra” while we were coming up with a name for her, and this is what she’s referred to in game data. Her character class is “antimcguffin.”

**Gold/scrap:**
Scrap is the in-game label for money, but in data the variable is simply “gold” (usually).

**Defender vs. Character:**
The members of your party are your characters, and the units you place in battle are defenders. This distinction is pretty subtle, but I throw it in as a heads-up for when you see me use one or the other term.

A character is an object that holds a party member’s data, basically, and a defender is the in-battle representation for that character. Azra is also a “defender” in this sense.

**Creature:**
In battle, the word “creature” means either a defender or an enemy. So, when I say something like “creatures can take damage” I mean, “defenders or enemies can take damage.”
Casual/Normal/Advanced/Extreme:
The battle challenge labels are “casual”, “normal”, “advanced,” and “extreme,” but internally the variables are “casual”, “easy”, “medium,” and “hard.”

**Alternate Mcguffin, Allies, and Minions:**
In the final battle, Zelemir shows up as a support character and alternate target for the enemies and is thus an “alternate mcguffin.” When Unazra shows up, she is sometimes an alternate mcguffin (the final sidequest) but usually simply a substitute mcguffin for Azra.

- Every battle always has at least one **mcguffin**
  - In battles with more than one **mcguffin**, only one is the **primary mcguffin** (in DQI this is usually Azra).
  - In battles with more than one **mcguffin**, all non-primary mcguffins are **alternate mcguffins**.
  - Mcguffins are immune to global spells such as "dragon fire" and will not be targeted by conventional enemy attacks
  - Mcguffins can only be harmed by enemies reaching their location
  - In DQI, a mcguffin is indicated by appearing at the beginning of the level, standing on a blue crater
- Any computer-controlled defender is called an **ally**. An ally may or may not be a mcguffin:
  - Tletl-Meztli in the final sidequest is technically a mcguffin, but no enemies actually target her location
  - Zelemir at the end of "Eztli-Tenoch's right hand" is NOT a mcguffin, and wholly controlled by a triggered script
  - Zelemir in the final battle is both technically and functionally a mcguffin, enemies target him separately from Azra
- (DQII exclusive) Some defenders can summon "minions" that are largely computer controlled and simpler than full defenders
  - The Weaselmancer's weasels
  - The Beast Master's beasts

###Programming Jargon:

**String:**
Some text, i.e, a ‘string” of letters, numbers, or other characters between quote marks. Not the stuff you tie up packages with.

Examples:
  “this_is_a_string”,
  “this is also a string”,
  “aNdIAmaStringT00!!!11110mgroflcopter”
