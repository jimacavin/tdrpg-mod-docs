##1.2. Creating your first mod

Before we get into anything fancy, let’s start by making a really simple mod.

  *  Start Defender’s Quest and click “start.”
  *  Click on the “Mod” button in the lower right hand corner.
  *  Select “create new mod”
  *  Enter a name
  *  Wait for the files to export
  *  Close Defender’s Quest

###What’s happening:
Defender’s Quest comes with a set of default assets and data embedded into the game itself. When you create a mod, it exports all of this information as loose files that you can modify. Then, you can load these changed files back into the game as a “mod,” or modification.

When the export is complete, it will display where you can find your new mod’s containing folder on your computer. This is the mod’s “root” directory, and we’ll refer back to it throughout this article.

Now that there’s a folder for it, here’s the basics of modding:

  *  Go to your mod’s root directory on your computer
  *  Change some of the files
  *  Start Defender’s Quest
  *  Click on the “Mod” button
  *  Select “load existing mod”
  *  Select your mod’s root directory

The game will load in all those assets, then restart the game. This time, it will be using your data instead of the game’s default assets. That’s the basics of creating a mod!
