##2.1 Index.xml

Open your mod’s copy of `maps/index.xml`.

This is one of the most important files in the entire mod, and is used for many different things. It’s called the “game index.”

This file, like most of the files in the game, is an XML file. It’s a simple data format similar to HTML, except the designer (that’s me!) defines all the tags. 

We have several top-level tags:

  * battle
  * overworld
  * tiles
  * features
  * hint_data
  * pearl_data
  * battle_screen_data
  * overworld_data
  * party_screen_data
  * town_data
  * reward_data

###2.1.1 [Battle tag](02_01_01_battle.md)

###2.1.2 [Overworld tag](02_01_01_overworld.md)
