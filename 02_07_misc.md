##2.7 Miscellaneous

####Tutorial levels

You’ll notice the first two battles only have rewards specified for beating them on “easy.” Whenever you don’t specify “med” or “hard” challenge rewards, it assumes the level is a tutorial, which changes a few things. First of all, it uses the small scroll menu that doesn’t let you choose a difficulty option. Second, it doesn’t display any stars on the map for that level, and it also tells the star-counting algorithm to ignore this level in terms of calculating overall stars earned. (Since no star is shown on the map, no star is counted for this level).

Be careful - the game is only set up to handle battles with a full set of rewards, or ones that only have “easy” rewards (ie, tutorials). If you specify “med” but not “hard”, or anything else that’s unexpected, the game might choke on your data. Furthermore, we recommend against offering challenge rewards other than simple progress for tutorials because none of that is displayed to the player.

####New Game+ Rewards

After the `<reward>` tags you’ll notice a bunch of <plus_reward> tags. These are exactly the same as the normal rewards, except these are the ones that will be loaded for a New Game+.

####Hint Data

You'll notice earlier we skipped over the `<hint_data>` tag.

```xml

When you equip the book of secrets, you'll sometimes notice a tone plays in certain screens of the game and shows a small flash. This is where those are all defined.

And that’s it for index.xml! That’s probably one of the most complicated files in the game, so now we’ll move onto something a bit simpler.
