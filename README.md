#0. Finding, Installing, and Playing Mods

[How to find and install a mod.](00.md)

If all you want to do is play a mod, this is the only section you need to read!

#1. Introduction

So, you want to make a mod for Defender’s Quest. This guide will show you how.

There is a [mod editor](https://github.com/Autoquark/dq1-unofficial-mod-editor) in the works, but it's in very early stages.
Until it's finished, you’ll be doing almost everything using simple text and image editors.

If you don’t know what XML is, for instance, I suggest [reading up on that now](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML).

**NOTE:**
*This guide is a work in progress. Many of the sections are stubs and still need to be filled out. Also, mod functionality has not been robustly tested, and might need a few more patches to bring it up to speed. I’ll need some help from adventurous modders to test the limits of the system.*

**SPOILER ALERT:**
*If you’re poking around in the game’s data files, you will come across spoilers! This guide talks about these files in great detail, so it will also contain lots of spoilers. Play the game first if you don’t want to be spoiled!*

#2. Core Data Files and **index.xml**

As you can see from [section 1.3](01_03_overview.md), there’s a lot of data files! Fortunately, the most important data is in only a few of them. These are the “core” data files, and they’ll be the ones we’ll talk about first.

They are:

```
xml/defender.xml
xml/defender_skills.xml
xml/game_progression.xml
xml/enemy.xml
xml/items.xml
xml/bonus.xml

xml/scenes/scripts.xml
xml/scenes/puppet_shows.xml
maps/index.xml
tables/exp.csv
tables/recruit.csv
tables/<character_class>.csv
```

This section will cover `index.xml`, the file that ties most of the game’s systems together. Open your mod’s copy of `maps/index.xml`.

This is one of the most important files in the entire mod, and is used for many different things. It’s called the "game index." This file, like most of the files in the game, is an XML file. It’s a simple data format similar to HTML, except the designer (that’s me!) defines all the tags. 

  1. [Battle](02_01_battle.md)
  2. [Overworld](02_02_overworld.md)
  3. [Overworld features](02_03_features.md)
  4. [Map pearls](02_04_map_pearls.md)
  5. [Towns](02_05_towns.md)
  6. [Battle rewards](02_06_battle_rewards.md)
  7. [Tutorial levels & NewGame+ Rewards](02_07_tutorial.md)

#3. Graphics

  1. [HD vs Original](03_01_hd_vs_original.md)
  2. [Layered vs. Baked HD sprites](03_02_layered_vs_baked.md)
  3. [Pipeline](03_03_pipeline.md)

#4. Defender Data

Two main files contains all the information that defines character classes, both in and out of battle.

`defender.xml`

```
<level_cap>    ← defines the level cap. Very simple.
<boost_cap>    ← maximum boost level
<recruit_cap>  ← max number of generic units
<class_cap>    ← max number of units in any given class
```

`defender_skill.xml`

```
<hidden_flavors> ← which attack flavors should be hidden*
<ui>             ← defines maximum number of passive ("trait") and attack ("technique") skills
<defender>       ← entry for a defender and all of their skills
```

*ie, flavors that shouldn't show up in the interface anywhere, such as "physical", so you don't see nonsense like "Hits and PHYSICALS a single target for 10 dmg."
