##2.1 Index.xml

Open your mod’s copy of `maps/index.xml`.

This is one of the most important files in the entire mod, and is used for many different things. It’s called the “game index.”

This file, like most of the files in the game, is an XML file. It’s a simple data format similar to HTML, except the designer (that’s me!) defines all the tags. 

We have several top-level tags:

  * battle
  * overworld
  * tiles
  * features
  * hint_data
  * pearl_data
  * battle_screen_data
  * overworld_data
  * party_screen_data
  * town_data
  * reward_data

###Battle
```<battle>``` starts with these three tags:

```xml
<tiles_per_square value="2"/>  <!-- how many individual tiles are in each battle square -->
     <tileset_style value="dq1"/>   <!-- whether we use DQI or DQII tileset format -->
     <casual hp="0.4" atk="0.3"/>   <!-- enemy hitpoint and attack multiplier for casual mode -->
```

Then we have the `<terrain>` sub-tag which has:
```xml
<legal>                         
     <type id="rock"/>            
     <!-- snip -->
     <type id="dull_pavement"/>
</legal>
```

This tag specifies which kinds of tiles are considered “legal” for defenders to stand on. To add new types of legal terrain, just add a line like the one below in between the opening and closing tags for “legal_terrain.”

`<terrain id="yellow_brick_road"/>`

If you add a tileset with a corresponding filename, and then use it in a battle, defenders will be able to stand on it.

The `id` attribute in the tag is a “reference” to a specific tileset. When you reference an id like this somewhere in the data, the game will expect to find a correspondingly named file in a specific location.

In this case, by mentioning "yellow_brick_road" as a legal tileset for defenders to stand on, the game will be looking for a corresponding graphic asset called "tile_yellow_brick_road.png"

If you pop on over to the `gfx\_hd\tiles\` and `gfx\_orig\tiles\` you’ll see a lot of graphics files. This is where the different tilesets you’re referencing are stored. We’ll get back to creating battle maps later, this is just a quick aside to show you how referencing works.

Next you'll see the `<water>` sub-tag:
```xml
<water>
	<type id="water"/>
	<type id="sewage"/>
</water>
```

This just specifies that the "water" tile and the "sewage" tile both count as water for the purposes of swimming enemies.

Then there's the `<path>` sub-tag:

```xml
<path>
	<type id="grey_dirt"/>
	<type id="black_dirt"/>
	<type id="red_dirt"/>
	<type id="black_pavement"/>
</path>
```

These tiles count as "path", the portion of the map that's legal for enemies to walk on, but which defenders can't stand on.

Now we're finished with the `<terrain>` tag. The next sub-tag in `<battle>` is `<interactive>`, and it looks like this:

```xml
<interactive>
	<feature id="crystal_small" type="bomb" x="0.75" y="1.00">
		<owner type="defender" class="mcguffin" handle="mcguffin" skill="crystal" />
		<bomb size="1" base_dmg="10" sfx="crystal_shatter" sfx_splash="small_explosion"/>
		<offset x="0.0" y="0.0"/>
		<terrain value="wall"/>
	</feature>
	<feature id="crystal_medium" type="bomb" x="1.00" y="1.00">
		<owner type="defender" class="mcguffin" handle="mcguffin" skill="crystal" />
		<bomb size="2" base_dmg="10" sfx="crystal_shatter" sfx_splash="medium_explosion"/>
		<offset x="0.0" y="-0.1"/>
		<terrain value="wall"/>
	</feature>
	<feature id="crystal_big" type="bomb" x="1.25" y="1.00">
		<owner type="defender" class="mcguffin" handle="mcguffin" skill="crystal" />
		<bomb size="3" base_dmg="10" sfx="crystal_shatter" sxf_splash="big_explosion"/>
		<offset x="0.0" y="-0.2"/>
		<terrain value="wall"/>
	</feature>
</interactive>
```

This defines various interactive elements that are available in battles. For instance, the "crystal" spell, which we'll get to later, uses the "spawn_interactive" action with these objects as potential targets.

###Overworld

The overworld tag is pretty simple:

```xml
  <overworld width="3986" height="2600"/>
```

It simply specifies the total scrollable area of the overworld. The values are given in base-600 pixels, which means that as your overworld scales in size above the smallest vertical resolution (600), these values will scale proportionately as well.

The `tiles` tag is only used in "original art" mode, and defines tile layers for the overworld:
```xml
   <tiles default="dirt">
	<tile rgb="0x808000" value="sand" layer="1"/>
	<tile rgb="0x008000" value="grass" layer="2"/>
	<tile rgb="0x0000FF" value="water" layer="3"/>
	<tile rgb="0xc4c4c4" value="black_stone" layer="4"/>
	<tile rgb="0xFFFF00" value="creep" layer="5"/>
	<tile rgb="0x00FF00" value="sewage" layer="6"/>
   </tiles>
```

**NOTE:** *The following method is ONLY used in original art mode. A totally different method is used to draw the HD overworld!*

These are the tilesets used for the overworld. The default="dirt" attribute in the opening tag specifies what the bottom-most tileset is.

Within the `<tiles>` tag are a list of `<tile>` tags (no 's'). Each of these specifies a pixel color in hexadecimal format (rgb), a tile id (value) and a layer number (layer). So, in this example, the overworld has a `dirt` layer on the bottom, then `sand`, then `grass`, then `water`, then `black_stone`, then `creep`, then `sewage`. All of the tilesets for these layers can be found in gfx\tiles\, but unlike normal battle tiles they start with the prefix "`tile_overworld_`" instead of just "`tile_`." So the overworld grass tile will be "`tile_overworld_grass.png.`"

The overworld is created by looking up several image maps and turning them into tile layers. These image maps are stored in the `maps/` folder, and have the format `overworld_<tile_id>.png`

So if you go to that folder, you should find files like `overworld_sand.png`, which specifies where all the sand is. The game will look for pixels that match the value in the corresponding `<tile>` tag, so for sand, it’s a kind of dark yellow (`0x808000`). Any other pixel value in that file is treated as empty space.

When designing the overworld, I usually have one master .psd file setup with each tileset as a separate layer, each set to "lighter color" so that the pixel color shows through and the black becomes transparent. This way I can see how the layers will look stacked together. When I’m done, I save each layer as a separate png.
